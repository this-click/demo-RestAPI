# Retrofit Demo app
Client Android app to the API "demo-RestAPI-server".

The motivation behind this project was the need to have access to an API, while learning Android Basics with Kotlin.
And what better way to have access than to build it yourself? :smile: 

## Description: 
A simple Android app which sends a GET request to an API I developed:
- displays a list of 3 dogs
- displays a detailed view for each dog, when clicked
- If GET was unsuccessful, display a relevant image

API repo: https://github.com/this-click/demo-pet-RestApi
